This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to implicit type coercion. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers and return a number. However, if we pass a string as an argument, TypeScript will implicitly coerce the string to a number. This can lead to unexpected results at runtime. The solution is to use type guards or explicit type assertions to ensure that the arguments are of the correct type.
